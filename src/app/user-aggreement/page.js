      <p>
        The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects the online
        privacy of children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect
        or maintain information from anyone under the age of 13, unless or
        except as permitted by law. Any person who provides information through
        the Services represents to us that he or she is 13 years of age or
        older. If we learn that information has been collected from a user under
        13 years of age on or through the Services, then we will take the
        appropriate steps to cause this information to be deleted. If you are
        the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a member
        of the Services or has otherwise transferred information to the
        Services, please contact Seenyor&nbsp; using our contact information
        below to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.

        Seenyor may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients in
        order to provide our services or for other legitimate business purposes.
        These recipients may include third-party service providers, affiliates,
        or business partners located outside of Australia.

        We take steps to ensure that any overseas recipients handle your

        Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). We implement appropriate
        safeguards, including contractual obligations, to ensure your

        recipients to commit to confidentiality and to use personal information
        only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.

        Privacy Policy as needed to reflect any changes in our data transfer
        practices.
