      <p>
        This Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you (“you” or the
        “Subscriber”) and Seenyor.com (“we,” “us,” or “Seenyor”). In this
        Agreement, “System” refers to the products you have purchased from
        Seenyor.com; “Services” refer to the services you have selected to
        receive from Seenyor, including but not limited to Emergency Dispatch
        Services, monitoring services, Account Management Services (each
        described below), and the Application, defined as the software or
        subscription services that may be downloaded to your smartphone, tablet,
        or other connected devices (or any related or connected third-party
        mobile devices or product peripherals that control or connect to any of
        the foregoing) to access Services (whether paid or free) remotely, as
        well as the customer support Services provided by Seenyor in support of
        any of the foregoing. “Premises” means the premises at which the System
        is located. The term “you,” as used in this Agreement, refers to any
        person or entity who accesses or uses the Services and any person or
        entity who creates an account, accepts this Agreement, and accesses or
        uses the Services, including any person granted access to the Services
        by you.

        Please read these terms and conditions carefully. These are the terms
        under which we are willing to provide you with the Services through a
        monthly, auto-renewing subscription (see below for billing details,
        term, how to cancel/terminate, etc.). This Agreement includes important
        disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnity obligations
        applicable to the Services and requires the use of binding arbitration
        to resolve disputes, rather than court trials or class actions (as

        in your online purchase. You understand and acknowledge that monitoring
        services, including cellular backup features, require an active
        subscription. Failure to maintain your subscription will result in the
        termination of your paid subscription, including all monitoring-related
        services. This includes the ability for our Monitoring Staff to monitor
        and support your System. Such termination may take effect immediately
        upon the end of your subscription. Your System will not function and
        also your (App and/or web portal) system controls and connectivity.

        <strong>2. Term and Termination</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Term of Agreement:
          <br />
        </strong>

        </strong>
        You have the right to cancel this Agreement within 10 days from the
        receipt of payment without any penalties. If you choose to cancel within

        required to pay an Early Termination Fee equivalent to the total
        remaining monthly charges on your contract. This fee is necessary as the

        <strong>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          No Refund Policy:
          <br />
        </strong>
        Except as provided during the 10-day cooling-off period, there will be
        no refunds for any payments made under this Agreement. This includes the
        initial payment and any subsequent monthly service charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Notice of Termination</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seenyor.com shall provide notice of termination to the Subscriber by
        email sent to the email address on file from Seenyor.com/Seenyor.au for
        your current online account. Seenyor’s termination shall be effective
        when the email notice is sent. If you do not provide an email address,
        Seenyor.com may send you a written notice of termination by regular
        mail, postage prepaid, and such notice shall be effective four (4) days
        after the day on which Seenyor.com sent the notice. Upon termination of
        this Agreement, Seenyor.com shall have no further obligation to you, and
        you shall have no further obligation to Seenyor.com, except for (i) the
        obligation to pay any outstanding amounts due for services rendered, and
        (ii) the obligations outlined in Sections 3-8, 13-19, and 24-41 of this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a Subscriber’s Service is activated (following any applicable
        promotional “free” period and any applicable practice period),
        Seenyor.com will bill the Subscriber’s chosen payment method the monthly
        fee for the Service for the upcoming month. Service billing will recur
        monthly on the same day of the month as the original bill date, unless
        and until the Service is terminated. For any month where that recurring
        date does not exist (e.g., if your recurring subscription date is the
        31st of the month and a month has only 30 days), your payment for the
        next month will be billed on the 30th of the preceding month.
        Subscriptions terminated before the billing date will not incur a charge
        for the upcoming month. Seenyor.com shall not refund any fees for the
        remaining term of the contract if you cancel after the 10-day
        cooling-off period. There are no partial refunds for the month of
        cancellation, and you will be responsible for the payment of the
        remaining months on your contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Payment for Services</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Subscriber shall pay Seenyor.com the periodic service charge in
        advance. You authorize Seenyor.com to charge your credit/debit card for
        the periodic (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) service charge when
        due. If charges are declined, Seenyor.com will resubmit the charges for
        approval and notify you of the declined charges by email while
        continuing to provide Emergency Dispatch Services for ten (10) days. If
        the charges are not approved and you do not make payment, Seenyor.com
        may, at its sole discretion, discontinue services without notice at or
        after the end of the ten (10) day period. If the Subscriber otherwise
        does not pay any charges when due, Seenyor.com may, at its sole
        discretion, terminate this Agreement and/or discontinue services without
        notice. For any past-due bills that have not been paid, Seenyor.com
        reserves the right to charge your credit/debit card on file at any time
        permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you sign up for a monthly auto-renewing subscription from Seenyor.com
        and your monthly billing date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we
        may charge you on the next business day. In the event your payment is
        returned due to insufficient or uncollected funds, you authorize
        Seenyor.com to resubmit, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.
        Payment processing fees associated with your form of payment, such as
        currency conversion fees, insufficient fund fees, reversal fees, or
        overdraft fees are your responsibility and will not be reimbursed by
        Seenyor.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Failure to Pay Your Monthly Fee:</strong> You agree to continue
        paying any relevant monthly service fee as part of your auto-renewing
        subscription until you or Seenyor.com terminate your subscription. In
        the event your account shows underpayment or overpayment, Seenyor.com
        reserves the right to issue a corrective charge or refund to your
        payment method on file. As permitted under any applicable law or
        regulation, YOU HEREBY GRANT SEENYOR.COM PERMISSION TO CHARGE YOUR
        PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE FOR ANY AMOUNTS DUE AT SEENYOR.COM’S DISCRETION
        AND TIME OF CHOOSING if Seenyor.com determines that you failed to pay
        for any one or more months of service (in whole or in part) upon a
        review of your account information. Seenyor.com may notify you of any
        necessary corrective charges by email, phone call, text/SMS, or in-app
        messaging. Such notice is optional at Seenyor’s sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Subscription Enrollment and Pre-Payment Terms</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you enroll in a monthly subscription, Seenyor may receive automatic
        updates from your issuing bank to keep your payment information current.
        If you wish to manually update or remove a payment method, you can do so
        by going to the ” Billing” section under your account settings or by
        contacting us at support@seenyor.com
      </p>
      <p>
        Seenyor.com may offer you the option to pre-pay for one or more months
        of service. If you choose to pre-pay for future months, you do so
        voluntarily and may still cancel your subscription subject to the terms
        outlined herein. Upon signing up for the service, you will be billed
        immediately for the agreed pre-paid period. However, please note that
        after the 10-day cooling-off period, no refunds will be issued for any
        unused pre-paid months of service unless exceptional circumstances apply
        (e.g., in the event of a significant life change).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you received a promotion as part of any pre-paid service, the
        promotion is contingent on you maintaining your existing subscription
        through the pre-paid period. However, Seenyor.com may, at its sole
        discretion, allow you to retain any promotional gift or value without
        requiring you to maintain your subscription through the pre-paid period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon completion of any applicable pre-paid time period, unless mutually
        agreed otherwise, your subscription will revert to an auto-renewing
        monthly subscription. Seenyor.com also reserves the right to convert
        your account to a monthly billing and renewal cycle at its sole
        discretion. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you want to
        check whether any pre-paid options are available for your specific
        account, please contact our Customer Service team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Insurance</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seenyor’s service charges are based solely on the value of the services
        provided and are not insurance premiums. These charges are unrelated to
        the value of property located on or near the premises. You acknowledge
        and agree that Seenyor.com is not an insurer and does not provide
        insurance coverage against any losses, as defined below. If you wish to
        have insurance coverage for losses, it is your responsibility to procure
        and maintain separate insurance policies from an insurance company or
        companies, solely at your cost and expense. This coverage should include
        all loss, damage, or expense (collectively, “Losses”), including
        property damage, personal injury (including death), economic losses, or
        any other form of loss, damage, or expense arising out of or in
        connection with, due to, or caused in whole or in part by: (i) this
        Agreement, including any breach of any representation, warranty,
        covenant, or obligation arising hereunder; (ii) the System; (iii) the
        Services (including third-party products and services); (iv) the active
        or passive, sole, joint, or several negligence of any kind or degree by
        you or any Seenyor.com party (as defined in Section 5); (v) the improper
        operation or non-operation of the System; (vi) breach of contract,
        express or implied, occurring before or after the signing of this
        Agreement; (vii) breach of warranty, express or implied; (viii) product
        or strict liability; (ix) the loss or damage to, or malfunction of,
        facilities necessary to operate the System, transmit any signal, or
        receive signals at any monitoring facility; (x) a claim for subrogation,
        indemnification, or contribution; (xi) a violation of any applicable
        consumer protection law or any other theory of liability or alleged
        fault on the part of any Seenyor.com party; (xii) a violation of any law
        prohibiting the interception of oral communications by electronic means;
        (xiii) the actions of any third party in responding to a signal from the
        System; or (xiv) any unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your
        personal information (collectively, the “Covered Claims”). Recovery for
        any Losses shall be limited to the insurance you purchase separately
        from an insurance company, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Limitations of Liability and Release</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        By agreeing to these terms, you are releasing Seenyor.com, its
        affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees,
        subcontractors, agents, and representatives (collectively, the “Seenyor
        Parties”), together with any providers of third-party products and
        services, on your behalf and on behalf of all others who make claims
        under this Agreement, from all liability arising out of or in connection
        with, due to, or caused in whole or in part by any Covered Claim, as
        defined in Section 4. Under no circumstances will Seenyor.com be
        responsible or liable to you for consequential or incidental damages,
        including without limitation, damages for personal injury, death, or
        damage to property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if any Seenyor
        Party is found liable for any Losses, as defined in Section 4, arising
        out of or in connection with, due to, or caused in whole or in part by
        any Covered Claim, any such liability shall be limited to the maximum
        sum of $2,500 AUD. This limitation is cumulative and will not be
        increased by the existence of more than one incident or claim.
        Seenyor.com disclaims all liability of any kind for its licensors and
        suppliers. Seenyor.com and you acknowledge and agree that it is
        impractical and extremely difficult to determine the actual damages, if
        any, that may result from a failure by Seenyor.com to perform any of its
        obligations. This agreed-upon amount is not a penalty and is the sole
        remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
        exclusion may not apply to you. Please refer to separate document user
        agreement and liability disclaimer for more information .

      <p>
        <strong>9. Communications Equipment and Services</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The System is designed to transmit signals to a monitoring facility
        through certain communications equipment and services, including but not
        limited to broadband, Wi-Fi, cellular, wireless, and/or landline
        telephone equipment and services (collectively, the “Communications
        Equipment and Services”). Regardless of the form of Communications
        Equipment and Services used, you understand that these may be
        interrupted, circumvented, unavailable (for a limited or extended
        period), or otherwise compromised, including as a result of equipment
        designed or used by a third party to cause false alarms or gain
        unauthorized access to or otherwise affect or control the Communications
        Equipment and Services or any video-related services. If the
        Communications Equipment and Services are inoperative or interrupted for
        any reason, there will be no indication of such at the monitoring
        facility, and the monitoring facility will not receive a signal from
        your system. Our devices are designed for general wellness purposes and
        are not classified as medical devices. Please be aware that, on
        occasion, these devices may transmit data that has not been medically
        validated or approved. Users should not rely on this data for medical
        decisions or as a substitute for professional healthcare advice,
        diagnosis, or treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are required to test the System’s data transmission with the
        monitoring facility at least monthly and immediately after the
        installation, modification, or repair of any Communications Equipment or
        Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must ensure that your Communications Equipment and Services are
        compatible with the System, especially when making any changes to them.
        Your access to and availability of the Application depend on (i) your
        computer, mobile device, home wiring, home Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth
        connection, and other related equipment and services; (ii) your Internet
        service provider; and (iii) your mobile device carrier. You must
        immediately repair (or cause to be repaired) any (i) problems with the
        Communications Equipment and Services, or (ii) problems with the System.
        Please consult the Owner’s Manual for your System for further important
        safety information regarding the System and the transmission of signals
        from your System.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL
        RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER WITH THE UNDERLYING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER
        (THE “UNDERLYING CARRIER”) OR ITS AFFILIATES OR CONTRACTORS, AND THAT
        YOU ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN
        SEENYOR.COM AND THE UNDERLYING CARRIER. IN ADDITION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
        AGREE THAT THE UNDERLYING CARRIER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND CONTRACTORS
        SHALL HAVE NO LEGAL, EQUITABLE, OR OTHER LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU,
        AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DEMANDS THEREFOR.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT DOMESTIC CELLULAR COVERAGE MAY GENERALLY BE
        LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES. IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA
        WITHOUT CELLULAR COVERAGE, YOUR INSTALLATION AND USE OF OUR SYSTEM AND
        SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO AND RELY SOLELY ON NON-CELLULAR
        COMMUNICATION (I.E., YOUR HOME WIFI CONNECTIVITY). THIS MEANS THAT EVEN
        THOUGH YOUR SYSTEM MAY INCLUDE A CELLULAR MODULE FOR BACKUP
        COMMUNICATION (ONLY AVAILABLE WITH A QUALIFYING SERVICE PLAN) WITH OUR
        MONITORING CENTRE, IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WITHOUT CELLULAR COVERAGE,
        YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE ANY BACKUP COMMUNICATION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10. Additional Equipment or Services</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have selected the System based on your personal considerations
        (e.g., cost, the condition of the Premises, insurance requirements,
        etc.). Additional equipment or services, which may come at an additional
        cost, can provide enhanced detection and security. You agree that any
        additional equipment or services provided by Seenyor.com shall be
        subject to this Agreement. For instance, you may request that, upon
        receiving signals from your System, the monitoring facility notify you
        of such activity (via live operator telephone call, text message,voice
        recording , or other form of electronic communication) in addition to or
        in lieu of providing the Emergency Dispatch Services described herein.
        We will honor any such request provided we have previously agreed in
        writing to do so. You also agree to pay Seenyor.com for such additional
        equipment or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your local council or municipality may require a license or permit or
        the payment of taxes in connection with the installation, use, or
        monitoring of the System. You are solely responsible for complying with
        such obligations and for providing Seenyor.com with any current license
        or permit number. You understand that Seenyor.com does not provide any
        installation or repair services for the System. You are responsible for
        providing and maintaining adequate power for all equipment related to
        the System.

      <p>
        <strong>11. False Alarms; Suspension of Service and Shut-Down</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that false alarms can occur, whether due to system errors
        or other factors. However, you agree to take reasonable precautions to
        minimize the occurrence of false alarms. Should your System trigger
        false alarms that result in fines, fees, costs, expenses, or penalties
        imposed on you, Seenyor.com, or the monitoring facility by any court,
        government agency, or other entity, you will be responsible for covering
        these charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that (i) you default under this Agreement, (ii) this
        Agreement or the Services are terminated by either party for any reason,
        (iii) the System sends excessive or unwarranted signals to the
        monitoring facility, or (iv) the System is deemed by monitoring facility
        personnel to be a “problem account,” Seenyor reserves the right to
        suspend Services and, if necessary, disconnect the System from the
        monitoring facility. This action does not waive Seenyors right to seek
        damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12. Increase in Charges</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seenyor.com may increase periodic recurring charges at any time under
        this Agreement by sending notice to you via email to the email address
        on file with Seenyor.com for your current online account. To the extent
        permitted by law, any change in charges can be made effective
        immediately after Seenyor provides notice of such a pricing change, at
        Seenyor’s sole discretion.
      </p>

        <strong>15. Applicable Law</strong>
      </p>

        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of Australia without reference to its conflicts of law rules. The

        penalty) within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, provided that the
        imposition of such a fee (together with the finance charge listed above)
        is permitted and does not exceed the maximum charge allowed under
        applicable law.
      </p>

        <strong>18. No Waiver of Breach</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of any breach of this Agreement by you shall not be considered a

        are cumulative, may be exercised concurrently or consecutively, and
        include all remedies available, even if not specifically referred to in

        connection with the Emergency Dispatch Services provided under Section
        23. Verification is done using data and signals received from the

      </p>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that Emergency Dispatch Services may be

        assessment of circumstances shown through the Event Verification
        Services. These personnel may decide that Emergency Dispatch Services
        are appropriate even before performing any other Alarm Verification
        steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event Verification Services are intended to assist you and the
        monitoring facility personnel in verifying an alarm event at the
        Premises, but they are not designed to reduce or eliminate any risk of
        loss. These services are not intended to replace traditional alarm
        monitoring services or to detect or prevent unauthorized intrusion onto
        the Premises or any other emergency conditions, including fire, smoke,
        carbon monoxide, medical emergencies, or water damage. The Verification
        Services are provided and shall be used solely for the verification of
        alarm events at the Premises and no other purpose.

        <strong>23. Emergency Dispatch Service</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        “Emergency Dispatch Services” shall be provided in accordance with this
        Agreement and consist solely of monitoring facility personnel
        telephoning the relevant governmental authorities (“Authorities”) or
        sending SMS/text notifications and alerts to individuals you have
        designated (“Responsible Parties”) or any company that provides on-site
        response services (“Third Party Responders”) upon the receipt of signals
        from your System reporting specific conditions
      </p>
      <p>
        Seenyor’s obligation to provide Emergency Dispatch Services shall be
        satisfied by monitoring facility personnel contacting (or attempting to
        contact) the Authorities, Responsible Parties, or Third Party
        Responders, or by leaving a voicemail or similar type message with the
        Authorities, Responsible Parties, or Third Party Responders. Emergency
        Dispatch Services are intended to reduce the risk of burglary, robbery,
        or other incidents occurring at the Premises but do not guarantee that
        such events will not occur or that there will be no personal injury or
        property loss as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monitoring facility will not contact (nor attempt to contact) any
        Third Party Responder on your behalf unless you have specifically
        contracted with Seenyor to provide such a service, or you have
        specifically requested that we provide such a service and we have agreed
        in writing to do so. Examples where you might desire that the monitoring
        facility attempt to contact a Third Party Responder include situations
        where (i) the Premises are located in a jurisdiction where the
        applicable Authorities will not respond to alarm signals at the Premises
        without prior verification of an actual alarm event, or (ii) where you
        desire a faster response time than what might otherwise be provided by
        the applicable Authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the circumstances, you acknowledge that, upon receipt of
        signals from your System, the monitoring facility will not contact (nor
        attempt to contact) any Third Party Responder unless you have previously
        contracted with Seenyor.com to provide such a service, or you have
        previously requested that we provide such a service and we have agreed
        in writing to do so.

        that urgent Notifications may not be timely sent or received and that
        neither Seenyor.com nor your wireless carrier guarantees that such
        Notifications will be delivered or sent.

      </p>
      <p>
        Upon detecting an event that may require attention (such as an emergency
        situation or unusual activity), monitoring facility personnel may, at
        their sole discretion, take one or more of the following steps to verify
        the need to notify the appropriate contacts (collectively, the “Event
        Verification Steps”):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Contact the Subscriber</strong>: Telephone or text, or
            attempt to telephone or text, the account holder or any secondary
            contact provided by the account holder.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Engage with Individuals at the Premises</strong>: Optionally
            engage in communication with any individuals at the monitored
            premises to confirm the need to report the event or any potentially
            urgent safety or security information to designated contacts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

        Following one or more of these Event Verification Steps, monitoring
        facility personnel may, at their sole discretion, decide whether to
        notify (or not notify) the designated contacts, such as family members,
        caregivers, or emergency responders. If monitoring facility personnel
        are unable to verify the need for notification, they are under no
        obligation to proceed with contacting the designated parties.

        Upon receiving a cancellation request from an authorized account
        user—such as through verified electronic communication (e.g., SMS/text
        confirmation) or oral advice (confirmed by a pre-established safe
        word)—monitoring facility personnel may, at their sole discretion,
        decide not to notify the designated contacts, such as family members,

        without notice, and you release Seenyor.com from all losses following
        any default or breach of this Agreement by you, or if the monitoring
        facility, Communications Equipment, or Services are destroyed, damaged,
        inoperable, or malfunctioning for any reason whatsoever, for the
        duration of such interruption of service. In such cases, you shall be
        entitled to a credit for the unearned charges paid for the period of
        interruption, upon your request. This credit shall not exceed more than
        one month’s service charge and shall be the limit of Seenyor’s
        liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this Agreement is terminated, or if the Services are suspended or
        terminated for any reason, you shall immediately disconnect the System

        contractor. Similarly, any Third Party Responder is also an independent
        contractor. Seenyor.com may, at its sole discretion, subcontract for the
        provision of any of the Services under this Agreement. The provisions of
        this Agreement benefit and apply to (i) any subcontractors engaged to
        provide any of the Services to you, including any monitoring facility
        and any Third Party Responder; and (ii) each of the Seenyor.com Parties
        (and any providers of Third-Party Products and Services, if applicable),
        and bind you to all such persons or entities listed in the foregoing
        subsection (i) or (ii) with the same force and effect as they bind you
        to Seenyor.com. Any subcontractor we engage is an independent contractor
        and not our partner or joint venturer. You authorize us to act as your
        agent for the purpose of working with, or providing any directions to,
        any subcontractors with respect to the provision of the Services. You
        authorize us to share your personal information with our subcontractors

        The section titles used herein are for the convenience of the parties
        only and shall not be considered in construing the provisions of this

      <p>
        If Seenyor.com breaches this Agreement, you shall provide Seenyor.com
        with written notice specifically identifying the nature of the breach
        and the provisions of this Agreement affected as a result of such

        following receipt of the written notice or, if the breach cannot be
        reasonably cured within such period, may promptly commence to cure and
        diligently proceed until cured. If Seenyor.com cures any such breach,
        this Agreement shall continue unabated, and Seenyor.com shall not be
        liable to you for any losses arising out of or in connection with, due
        to, or caused in whole or in part by any such breach.

      <p>
        <strong>39. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF
          YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL
          BASIS.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the event of any dispute or disagreement between the parties
            (under tort law, contract law, including but not limited to
            auto-renewal disputes, billing, or service disputes, etc.), or claim
            or question by a party arising from or relating to this Agreement or
            the breach thereof (collectively, a “Dispute”), the parties shall
            use their best efforts to settle the Dispute. To this effect, the
            parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith
            and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and
            equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do
            not reach such a solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon
            notice by either party to the other, such Dispute shall be finally
            settled by arbitration administered by an agreed-upon independent
            arbitration body in accordance with its rules. Once the Dispute is
            submitted for arbitration, each party must pay the appropriate
            filing fees. All expenses of the arbitrator and any arbitration body
            expenses shall be borne by Seenyor.com. The parties will remain
            individually responsible for their own attorney costs or other
            non-arbitration body-required costs, including but not limited to
            the expenses of witnesses for either side, which shall be borne by
            the party producing such witnesses. If an in-person arbitration
            hearing is required, it will be conducted at a location reasonably
            convenient for both parties, to be agreed upon or determined by the
            independent arbitration body or the neutral arbitrator. If the
            arbitrator finds that a dispute is frivolous or was brought for an
            improper purpose, the prevailing party shall recover all fees paid
            to the arbitration body and, at the arbitrator’s discretion, an
            award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral
            arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 15
            years of experience in the substantive practice area related to the
            Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the
            chosen arbitration body’s rules. The arbitrator will apply
            applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and will
            determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts
            based upon the record and no other basis. The arbitrator’s decision
            must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each
            claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential
            findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if
            any) is based. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
            be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of
        this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other
        relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, with arbitration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>(A) There is no judge or jury,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (B) The arbitration proceedings and arbitration outcome are subject
            to certain confidentiality rules, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>(C) Judicial review of the arbitration outcome is limited.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The parties agree that the arbitration shall be confidential. All
        parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to
        be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if you or
            Seenyor.com want to assert a dispute against the other, then you or
            Seenyor.com must commence it (by delivery of written notice as set
            forth in Section 40) within 1 year after the dispute arises—or it
            will be forever barred.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement does not
            apply to any claim seeking damages in tort for bodily injury,
            including emotional or psychological injury, or property damage of
            any kind, including claims for loss of use or diminution in value of
            property. In addition, there shall be no right or authority for any
            dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis
            involving any dispute brought in a purported representative capacity

        We may revise and update this Agreement from time to time. To the extent
        it applies and is permissible by law, all changes are effective
        immediately when we post them on the Seenyor.com Website. Unless you
        exercise your right to opt out of changes (as described below), your
        continued use of any Seenyor.com Services or Website means that you
        accept and agree to the changes as they relate to such usage after the
        date of the revision, and such continued use is your consideration for
        the changed terms. No amendment to this Agreement will retroactively
        modify the parties’ agreed-to dispute resolution provisions for
        then-pending disputes, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in
        writing. For the avoidance of doubt, “then-pending disputes” means any
        legal action filed before any court or tribunal. Within 30 days of the
        posting of a revised Agreement on the Website, you have the right to
        reject changes that were made by providing written notice of your intent
        to opt out of any revised terms to this Agreement by emailing
