        by mail or email (“Notification”). Your Notification should include the
        information described below. Please be aware that under applicable law,

      </p>
      <p>
        A description of the copyrighted work that you allege is being
        infringed. If multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are
        covered in a single notification, provide a representative list of such
        works.
      </p>
      <p>
        A description of the material that is claimed to be infringing and that
        is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, along with
        information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as
        an address, telephone number, and/or email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the

        owner, its agent, or the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and
        that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the allegedly
        infringed material.
      </p>
      <p>Notifications should be sent to:</p>
      <p>Attn: Legal Department, support@seenyor.com</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        You may submit your Counter Notification to us by mail or email as set
        forth above.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the
        requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled
        material after ten (10) business days but no later than fourteen (14)
        business days from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless

        informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you
        from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in
        question. Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the
        disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification,
        you may be liable for damage. Filing a false Counter Notification
        constitutes perjury.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        Every Agreement is for a minimum term of two (2) years from the date of
        signing. During this period, the Agreement cannot be terminated by the
        Customer except in cases of proven breach by Seenyor&nbsp; of its
        obligations under this Agreement, or other circumstances as mandated by
        Australian Consumer Law.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If Seenyor&nbsp; finds it necessary to terminate this Agreement for good
        cause, such as your failure to pay any amounts due hereunder, we may do
        so following ten (10) days written notice. Should this Agreement be
        terminated by Seenyor&nbsp; for any reason, your obligations under this
        Agreement shall survive such termination.

        After the initial two-year period, either party may terminate the
        Agreement by providing thirty (30) days written notice. Our obligation
        to provide service shall terminate automatically as of the thirtieth
        (30th) day following the date of such notice. Subject to the terms of
        this Agreement, Seenyor&nbsp; shall refund the Customer any amounts
        pre-paid for services not provided following such date.

      <p>Disputes, Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights</p>
      <p>
        If there is a dispute between users of the Website, or between users and
        any third-party, you understand and agree that Seenyor&nbsp; is under no
        obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with
        one or more other users, you hereby release Seenyor , its officers,
        employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and
        damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or
        unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising
        out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our services.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If there is a dispute, controversy or claim (“Dispute”) between you and
        Seenyor&nbsp; regarding these Terms and Conditions or the Website, you
        agree that we will resolve any Disputes through final and binding
        arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and Seenyor&nbsp;
        hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Dispute. The arbitration
        shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules
        of the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration
        (“ACICA”) and, where appropriate, the ACICA’s Supplementary Procedures
        for Consumer-Related Disputes. A single arbitrator will hear and
        determine the arbitration, which will be kept confidential along with
        the proceeding and all elements of it, such as pleadings and briefs. The
        arbitrator’s decision will be both final and binding.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        You and Seenyor&nbsp; agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
        Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by
        law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no
        right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
        basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right
        or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
        capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If any element of this Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
        it will no longer be in effect, but the rest of this Section will
        continue to stand. This Section of this Agreement will be kept in effect
        until you terminate your relationship with Seenyor .
